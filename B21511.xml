         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAving thoſe Obligations upon me, which will not permit me to neglect what (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my power I judge) may be acceptable to you, I could not forbear to give you ſome Account of this days Work, in the Choice of Citizens to ſerve in Parliament for this City of <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You know Sir, it was about the beginning of <hi>September,</hi> that I left your very agreeable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and came to <hi>London,</hi> where I read every day new Pamphlets, and heard Diſcourſes, ſome commending the Choice of ſuch men for the Enſuing Parliament as had ſhewed themſelves Zealous for the Defence of the King's Perſon, the Proteſtant Religion, and Government of <hi>England,</hi> and were upon thoſe Grounds, Voters for the Bills againſt Popery, and the D. for Juſtice upon <hi>Danby,</hi> and the Popiſh Plotting Lords, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whilſt other Pamphlets and Diſcourſes did bitterly inveigh againſt the late Commons in Parliament, as Factious and Ill-minded men, fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the Leven of 41, Fanatically inclined, dangerous to the Church and Monarchy, worſe than Papiſts; and therefore the greater care ſhould be to keep them, and ſuch as they were out of the Parliament-Houſe. The Graver ſort of theſe men, would charge thoſe late Members with great Imprudence, Want of Moderation, and raſhneſs in their Reſolves, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Bill againſt the D. which they would perſwade was inconſiſtent with Allegiance and Religion too. And all this Outcry was made in the behalf of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and under pertrxt of her true Sons. The Act of Oblivion made by this King ſeemed now to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got, and whilſt ſome charged others with the Deſigns of 41, they themſelves did with all their Might endeavour to revive the ſame Spirit and Rancour, which raiſed the Storms of thoſe days. The Papiſts and Presbyterians were brought upon the Stage and parallel'd, but ſo, that the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ware ſtill more dangerous than the former. In ſome of theſe Pamphlets, Publiſhed under the Vizar of the Church of <hi>England</hi> men one might eaſily diſcover the Lineaments of a <hi>Jeſuite:</hi> for even the Murder of Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi> by the Papiſts was made doubtful; and they could not forbear to cite the Texts of Scripture in <hi>Latine,</hi> though that Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome is obſolete among us Proteſtants. The Duke of <hi>Y</hi>'s Preſence at Court added Vigor and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to theſe agents, which being perccived by many conſidering Citizens, gave occaſion to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs made by Sir <hi>Tho. Player</hi> in their Names, that the City-Guards might be increaſed; for the Argument was very plain, If there was need of any Guards when the Duke was Abſent, then there was need of more in his Preſence, when the Popiſh Party did manifeſtly take Courage and Activity from that Cauſe.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:204907:2"/>
            <p>This alſo they did endeavour to improve to the Advantage of their Cauſe, by interpreting theſe Addreſſes to be Factious, and the Fore-runners of moſt miſchievous Actions. And now the Kingly Government was underminded, becauſe the Popiſh Succeſſor was feared; and the Church of <hi>England</hi> was like to be Subverted, becauſe ſome Citizens had the Courage to open their Mouths, in humbly Repreſenting their Dangers from the Papiſts. And yet in the mean time Sir <hi>T. P.</hi> is a Devout Son of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and inferiour to no man in the City, in Abilities for Publick Employments; and ſuch he did appear in the laſt Parliament, where they would hear him with as much Readineſs, and employ him in their greateſt Truſts as ſoon as any; he was one of their Secret Committee; he was one of their Commiſſioners for Disband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Army, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But all muſt now turn to his Prejudice; he was a Popular Man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be feared and hated. Would you not wonder, that the Experience of a man's Ability and Integrity in Truſts, and the Love and Eſteem he reaps thence ſhould be an Argument againſt his being employed. But this was the Handle our <hi>Yorkiſts</hi> took this man's Actions by, and now they labour to improve this againſt his being choſen by the City into the Enſuing Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and for his ſake all the reſt of their late Citizens in Parliament muſt be rejected, and men more firm to the Church (that is in truth more for the Dukes Intereſt) choſen; for all theſe Four (it ſeems) had Voted for the Bill of Excluſion.</p>
            <p>Another Occaſion of Clamouring in the <hi>Anti-Popiſh</hi> Citizens was, that ſome of them, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing long obſerved the Great and Unneceſſary Expence their Sheriffs are at in their Shrievalties; inſomuch that no man can be capable of Holding that Office, except he have an overgrown Eſtate, and conſequently the Magiſtrates muſt be choſen out of thoſe few that are ſo rich, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever unqualified with Abilities befitting their Places, and others, better qualified, muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, becauſe they are not ſo rich; conſidering alſo, that this year (in the Condition we ſtand with our <hi>Popiſh</hi> Enemies) is like to require men of beſt Parts and Knowledge in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the City; and finding one Mr. <hi>Jenkins</hi> to be well qualified with Underſtanding, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Integrity (though not with a great Eſtate) they reſolved to chuſe him as a man fit for theſe difficult Times, and that would reduce the Charge to ſuch a moderation as might make it ſupportable by one of an indifferent Eſtate, and to keep out a Man ſtrongly addicted to the D. of <hi>Y</hi>'s Party, whom they underſtand ſome aimed at; and therefore ſo many of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Hall</hi> held up their Hands for Mr. <hi>Jenks,</hi> that it could not well be decided on whom the Choice fell without a Poll, but Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> carried it. This was made ſuch a Crime, as if all that Voted for Mr. <hi>Jenks,</hi> had preſently a Deſign under his Conduct to raiſe a Rebellion, and turn the Government of the City and Nation upſide down; and this is reflected on Sir <hi>T. P.</hi> becauſe one of the Addreſſes to the Lord Mayor, was made the ſame Morning, and by many of the ſame Perſons that were at <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> to chuſe a Sheriff: as if indeed ſo many Citizens, many of them of good Eſtates, underſtanding Men, Lovers of Peace, ſhould all of a ſuddain run mad, and in that Fit go to chuſe one, that ſhould infallibly lead them and their Families into Ruine; but this and nothing elſe could be the Deſign of this Choice, if you will believe our City-<hi>Yorkeiſts,</hi> and ſome others that they could impoſe upon. This I am told, is the firſt time in the Memory of Man, and perhaps ever ſince there were Sherriffs of <hi>London,</hi> that any man was endeavoured to be choſen into that Office for Love, and not for Envy and Ill-will.</p>
            <p>In the Management of a Second Addreſs, another Circumſtance aroſe, which the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries made Sport with. The Lord Mayor had anſwered the Citizens, that he would call a Lieutanancy on <hi>Thurſday;</hi> and then if half a Dozen of them would come with Sir <hi>T. P.</hi> and offer their Reaſons for their Propoſal, they ſhould be heard. This was interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Promiſe in, Sir <hi>T. P.</hi> and his Not appearing when the Lieutenancy met, a breach of Promiſe; and a Declaration was made by the Lieutenancy, entred in their Books, and put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Gazette</hi> accordingly, with divers other Reflections upon the Citizens that had appeared in that aforeſaid Addreſs.</p>
            <p>Thus the poor Proteſtants that are afraid of Popery, and Arbitrary Power with it, were banded againſt; and now that the Lieutenancy was on the other ſide with them that uſurped the Title of Church-men and <hi>Anti-Fanaticks,</hi> theſe men muſt be quite run down, nothing ſhall ſerve thoſe mens Turns, but the Excluding them not only from Parliamentary Seats, but throwing them out of their other Offices, when tme ſhould come for repeating Elections. And that they had found their Strength in the Election of Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi> Sheriff, they doubted not to carry every thing as they pleaſed. This ground gained, they preſs on by many Clubs and Meetings, where they make their Party as induſtriouſly as a newly Commiſſioned Captain la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to compleat ſuch a number of Souldiers, as may enable them to paſs Muſter, and have right to Pay. Here they drink and talk themſelves into a great Confidence of their
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:204907:2"/> Numbers: For the Deſigning Men, think that's the way to encreaſe them: for there are not a few, that love to be on the prevailing ſide, right or wrong. They fill the City with Boaſtings and Threats, their Party is ſo numerous now, they ſhall fulfill all their Pleaſure; they triumph already, as having got a Victory; they brag, that all the Church-men are on their ſide, that the Day of Election ſhall diſcriminate between the Loyal Sons of the Church, and the Fanaticks; to that end they would have a Poll, ſo ſhould ſee what Church-men durſt be againſt them.</p>
            <p>Then they offer Wagers upon the Choice, from one Guinny to an hundred againſt one or two or all the former Repreſenters in Parliament. Here the Popiſh Party, the Plotters, the Jeſuites are quite laid aſide. It's no longer Papiſts and Proteſtants, but Fanaticks and Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-Men. The Popiſh plot of Seventy eight is aſleep, or queſtioned. Ask one of theſe Sticklers, whether there was a Popiſh Plot againſt the Life of the King, the Proteſtant Religion and Government, he would anſwer minceingly, <hi>I do not make it an Article of my Creed.</hi> The King's Witneſſes were expoſed to all the Obloquy and Reproach imaginable.</p>
            <p>By theſe Arts and Tricks, the moderate and hearty Church-men, as well as the Diſſenters, were put upon Defence and Apology. They are charged as Revolters, Degenerate Sons of the Church, and of ſuſpected Loyalty, ſo that theſe were amazed, they wondered at and bemoan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Change that appeared in the Actings of ſome Citizens, Zealots indeed for our Church, but blown up by Popiſh Breath into a too vehement Flame, tending manifeſtly to the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of themſelves and others. Some of the more Judicious and Eminent Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> began to expreſs their ſad Reſentments of theſe Tranſactions; and did what became them to ſtop the Popiſh Torrent. In the end, the Day of Election came, <hi>October</hi> the <hi>7th.</hi> when there was a numerous and thronged H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll; ſome without Doors, that durſt not venture themſelves in ſo great a Crowd, for all expected a Poll, and prepared themſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. But all this great Noiſe and Roaring by theſe Boaſters, proved the Groanings of the Mountains, which brought forth a Mouſe.</p>
            <p>It's generally reckon'd, there were in that Aſſembly of Livery-men, between Five and Six Thouſand Men, and they were ſo unanimous in their Choice, that it's Judged by impartial and judicious Men, that he that had moſt Voices among theſe <hi>Yorkiſts</hi> (in oppoſition to the City's former Choice) had not above five hundred at moſt, and ſome ſay three hundred Voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; upon which <hi>I</hi> crave your patience till <hi>I</hi> make ſome Remarques.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It's manifeſt that it was the Popiſh Intereſt and Agents, that made all this Buſtle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and Clamour in the name of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> for really and in truth, the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> appeared againſt them, if ten to one in the whole can comprehend the Church of <hi>England:</hi> for the moſt favourable Account makes them but Hundreds for Thouſands, or one for ten; and if you rekon half of theſe to have been Diſſenters, there will ſtill remain five to one of the true Church-men; if you reckon the Diſſenters more than that number, you will make them too conſiderable; if leſs, then will the ſober Church-men be ſo much the more conſiderable, and better bear the Denomination of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And it cannot be imagined, that theſe few Church-men (whereof ſome are well minded) could make ſo hideous a Noiſe, and be ſo unmeaſurably concerned in oppoſition to their Brethren, if they had not been agitated by Jeſuitical Emiſſaries.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Theſe Well-minded Men that were thus drawn in by theſe Plotters, ſhould ſee how their unwary Zeal expoſes them to be made a Property and Inſtrument for the worſt of Purpoſes. They deſign only to divide us, to beget Hatred and Animoſities between us, that in purſuit of one another, they may eſcape, till they can get an opportunity to deſtroy us all; which they will eaſily do, if they can keep Parliaments from making Freſh and neceſſary Proviſions againſt them. If you were Papiſts, and in their Caſe, would you tread any other ſteps than thoſe that theſe men walk in. You know they can take any Shapes, make any Pretence, uſe any Argument that will work. You know they have no other Argument to uſe at this time, but to pretend high for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and againſt Forty one. So did theſe Members in the Penſionary Parliament, that were caſt out thence for being Papiſts. Surely, Gentlemen, you have a high Opinion of your ſelves, to think that You are the only men concerned for the Church of <hi>England;</hi> but your Neighbours ten for one, know you are but abuſed <hi>Machins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. It appears how weak the Duke of <hi>Y</hi>'s Intereſt is in this City; Ten to one is odds enough in a good Cauſe, and who will deny that to be a Good Cauſe, which is Defence of our Lives and Properties, the Concerns of us and our Poſterities both for this World and the World to come, againſt moſt Superſtitious Enemies, which of all Enemies are the moſt Cruel and Savage? But if the whole City could have met, and given their Voices in this Election<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it may well be preſumed there would have been forty for one for their old Patriots.</p>

We may perceive that the Lieutenancy of the City was choſen, when the D. of <hi>Y.</hi> influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced the Court: for the moſt part of them appeared openly in his Cauſe; they made their Declaration in the Gazette on his behalf, and on purpoſe to ſlur the Old and New Elected Parliament-men; they uſed their Intereſt againſt them; but their Intereſt and the Dukes being one, could not make in reality a tenth part of the City, though in Noiſe and Outcries they made more than half. Oh unhappy City! whoſe Governours of the <hi>Militia</hi> are for the moſt part Servants to thoſe that you moſt dreadfully fear.</p>
            <p n="5">5. We may hence take this Political Remarque, that we muſt not judge of the Temper of the People from loud Clamour. I conceive our Stateſ-man on both ſides were miſtaken, and thought the number of the <hi>Yorkiſts</hi> had been vaſtly greater, than upon Tryal it appeared. It was a great happineſs to true Proteſtants, that there was the occaſion of ſuch a Deciſion; for otherwiſe the Miſtake might have done the Papiſts as much Service, as if it had been really ſo.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, we find our Enemies Zeal and Diligence in their worſt of Cauſes to be great, and it may provoke Proteſtants to Fervor and Activity in the beſt; otherwiſe we are like to be deſtroyed. I mean not that we ſhould travel forbidden Paths, or go over Hedge and Ditch to come at our Journeys end; but in ſuch Caſes as this, the Choice of Citizens to ſerve in Parliament, and all other caſes wherein we are juſtified by Law, neither Danger, nor Eaſe, nor Loſs ſhould prevail upon us to be luke-warm or negligent. The Plotters have for theſe thirteen or fourteen years, kept back the Diſſenters from giving due Aſſiſtance and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the true and ſeeing Country Royalliſts, by crying out Forty one againſt them. Now they practice to divide thoſe Royal Lovers of their Country and Religion among themſelves, by pretending Zeal for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and Caution againſt Forty one. But if, when His Majeſty and the Parliament have made long ago, an Act <hi>of Oblivion,</hi> and time and our enemies Plots and Practices have made the Royalliſts and Parliamenteers of one mind and Concern for Preſervation of our King, our Religion, our Selves and Poſterities; if we will not all joyn Hands in this work, as far as the Laws of God and our Countrey allow us, we ſhall deſerve to periſh, and be no more pittied, than daſtardly Fools, that are afraid to defend our Religion and Lives, leſt we be ill ſpoken of; a greater Folly than to die for fear of dying. Thus, Sir, having given you ſuch an Account of this Notable Affair, as my Abilities and Haſte would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, I take Leave,</p>
